## 📊 First Time Usage

### Allocate Your First Income

2. Enter an amount (e.g., 50000)
3. Choose a preset strategy:
   - **Balanced**: 50% Living, 20% Emergency, 15% Investments, 15% Savings
   - **Aggressive**: More towards investments
   - **Conservative**: More towards emergency fund
   - **Growth**: Maximum investment focus
4. Or adjust sliders manually
5. Click **"Allocate Funds"**

### Understanding Your Dashboard

#### Metrics Cards
- **Total Balance**: Sum of all buckets
- **Total Income**: Lifetime earnings
- **Total Expenses**: Lifetime spending
- **Net Cash Flow**: Income - Expenses

#### Budget Buckets
- **Living Expenses** 🏠: For daily necessities
- **Emergency Fund** 🚨: For unexpected events
- **Investments** 📈: For growth opportunities
- **Savings** 🎯: For long-term goals

#### Status Indicators
- 🟢 **Healthy**: Bucket > ₹5,000
- 🟡 **Moderate**: Bucket between ₹2,000 - ₹5,000
- 🔴 **Low**: Bucket < ₹2,000 (Refill recommended)

### How Simulation Works

#### Automatic Events
The system generates random financial events:
- **Income**: Salary, Bonus, Interest, Dividend
- **Expenses**: Rent, Groceries, Utilities, Emergency, Entertainment

#### Adaptive Economy
- When balance is low: More income events
- When balance is high: More expense events

#### Budget Integration
- Income: Auto-allocated using balanced strategy
- Expenses: Auto-deducted from appropriate buckets
- Alerts: Generated when buckets run low

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### 1. Maintain Emergency Fund
Always keep your emergency fund above ₹5,000 to handle unexpected events.

### 2. Monitor Alerts
Check the alerts section regularly. Red (critical) alerts need immediate attention.

### 3. Rebalance Regularly
If a bucket is depleted, allocate more funds to it from your next income.

### 4. Use Presets
Presets are based on proven financial strategies. Start with "Balanced" and adjust later.

### 5. Review Transaction History
Click "Budget History" to see all allocation and expense events.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Budget System Not Working?
1. Check if `budget_system.py` is running (Terminal 2)
2. Look for errors in the Python console
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Click "Refresh" button in the app

### Expenses Not Deducting?
1. Ensure you have funds in relevant buckets
2. Check alerts for deficit warnings
3. Allocate more income to depleted buckets

### Can't Allocate Income?
1. Ensure total allocation ≤ income amount
2. All buckets must have valid amounts (≥ 0)
3. Check for error messages on screen
